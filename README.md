# corner-store-inventory
1.Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This was designed to intake a list of items, purchased over the course of time, and return the metrics and rates at which they were purchased.
  This was achieved through; Returning an overall list of items and their purchase numbers (also through visual representation) and through specific item name seachres.
2.What did you do particularly well?
  I feel my strongest aspect in this project was to achieve the list of items and their frequency through python dictionaries.
3.Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  My code could certainely have been more enhanced through exception handling. My understanding of it is still rather poor. I used a psuedo-exception handling
  through uses of cin.fail() to detect errors in input.
4.Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most difficult piece to write for me was the histogram part of this project, this being a result of not having confidence with file handling prior. I have
  since learned much in terms of file handling and feel exceptionally more adept with it.
5.What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  File handling. As previously stated, I was rather weak in that area.
6.How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Through the use of python integration. The functions were sizeable smaller and more efficent. Using them in tandem with C++ went miles in terms of line saving.
